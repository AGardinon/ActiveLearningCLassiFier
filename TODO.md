1. Tutorial notebooks
	- different clf algorithms and accuracy
	- dummy data creator
	- plotting functions

2. code improvments
	- performace testing code
	- gridCV search for the best parameters of the classifier (rule of thumbs)
	- add a quick hypertune with two kernels (how to set it up? idk no test data

! Possible problems:
	- entropy search space can induce narrow search of cluster of points
this can impact the search of points
-> solution would be to introduce a threshold percentile on entropy upper limit selection
